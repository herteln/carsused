Practical Application Assignment 11.1: What Drives the Price of a Car
What Drives the Price of a Car?
The project consists of an original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. The goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of our analysis, provides clear recommendations to clients or a used car dealership or as to what consumers value in a used car.

To frame the task, throughout these practical applications we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM. This process provides a framework for working through a data problem.

Link to Jupyter notebook:
This provides a step-by-step proces to solve the business problem. this framework is motived by the standardized CRISP-DM. We state the business problem, Explore data, clean and prepocess data, model the data, evaluate them and later conclude with interesting findings. Refer to the link below:

Model Features:
Considered three independent variables and one target variable

independent variables
year
manufacturer
odometer
Target variables
price
Findings:
From our analysis, the year shows a strong correlation with price compared to odometer reading or manufacturer features. This implies that recently manufactured vehicles are likely to cost more than older cars.

Conclusion:
Our findings are in line with real-world observations, which clearly state that vehicles recently manufactured are highly priced. This can be attributed to the new features and modifications that come with new developments. These findings provide clear recommendations to clients, used car dealerships, or consumers on how to value a used car.
